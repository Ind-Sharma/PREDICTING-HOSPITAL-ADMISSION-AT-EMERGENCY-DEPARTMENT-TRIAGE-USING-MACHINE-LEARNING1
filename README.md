# PREDICTING-HOSPITAL-ADMISSION-AT-EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT-TRIAGE-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This project aims to improve emergency department workflows by predicting patient admissions at the triage stage using machine learning models. By accurately forecasting admissions, hospitals can better prioritize patients and manage limited resources more efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Emergency Departments around the world suffer from overcrowding and long patient wait times. Predictive modeling can assist with triage and resource allocation, leading to improved patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
